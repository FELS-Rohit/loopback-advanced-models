# loopback-advanced-models

The aim of this project is to experiment with loopback models and to serve as
an example for fellow developers.

## Abstract

It is initiated and maintained by:

- [Pulkit Singhal](https://github.com/pulkitsinghal)
- [Rares Golea](https://github.com/rgolea)
- [Bram Borggreve](https://github.com/beeman)

After an online meeting we thought it would be a good idea to work on a reference
project that could show of the more advances usages of modes in loopback.

## What is implemented

### AppModel

This is a model that extends PersitedModel and can be used in its place. It adds
automatically updated created/modified properties to a model.

## What to implement

### ACL's

There should be some advanced ACL examples in place.

### Hiding remote methods

The example should hide some of the remote methods using the built-in methods.

### Unit testing

All functionality should be unit-tested to proof their working.

### Angular SDK

All functionality should have an AngularJS demo.

### Please tell us what should be added
